## Prerequisites

To make the full use of this package, you will need 2 fonts defined in INRAE's design system : `Raleway` and `Avenir Next Pro Cn` that can be downloaded [here](https://charte-identitaire.intranet.inrae.fr/content/download/3007/30036?version=5)

## Installation

The package can be installed using:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("davidcarayon/InraeThemes")
```

> Note: Older versions with Rmarkdown templates (i.e., 1.0.1) can still be downloaded using:

### ggplot2 themes and scales

Customize your ggplots using INRAE's colors with `theme_inrae()` and/or `scale_<fill/color>_inrae()`.

Here are examples using the iris dataset.

```{r example, message = FALSE, fig.showtext=TRUE, fig_retina = 1, warning = FALSE}
library(InraeThemes)
library(ggplot2)

# If needed
sysfonts::font_add_google("Raleway")

# Load the fonts
showtext::showtext_auto()

# Load data
data(iris)

# The plot
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, group = Species)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Species, shape = Species), size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, aes(color = Species)) +
  scale_color_inrae() +
  labs(
    title = "Iris dimensions",
    subtitle = "This is a subtitle explaining what you can see in this plot",
    x = "Sepal Length",
    y = "Petal Length",
    color = "Iris species",
    shape = "Iris species"
  ) +
  theme_inrae()

ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = Species), alpha = 0.5, position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_inrae() +
  labs(x = "Sepal Width", y = "Frequency", title = "Sepal Width distribution") +
  theme_inrae()
```

### Bootstrap theme

This package also provides a Sass theme built with [{bslib}]([https://](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/)): bs_inrae(). Preview the theme with:

```r
bslib::bs_theme_preview(bs_inrae())
```

![](man/figures/cap_bslib.png)

And can be used in any Shiny app with :

```r
ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = InraeThemes::bs_inrae(),
  ...
)
```

## Project templates

This package provides an opinionated project directory structure for data analysis which can be either used by going though `Projects > New Project > New Directory` in Rstudio or by using :

```r 
new_analysis("myproj")
```
